Last day at <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2013/" target="_blank">GOTO Aarhus</a> has ended. It has been a great conference with interesting talks, a lot of networking and even coding.

<h3>:D The highlights</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2013/presentation/How%20to%20become%20accomplished" target="_blank">keynote</a>. Unlike the two previous days, the keynote by <a href="https://twitter.com/chadfowler" target="_blank">Chad Fowler</a> was really fun and inspiring.</li>
        <li>Talking. I didn't attend that many presentations today. Mostly because I couldn't find a lot of interesting stuff, but also because I liked hanging out at the bloggers lounge. A lot of smart people are gathered there and discussing tech stuff with these guys is sometimes more awarding than going to presentations. GOTO is all about the networking, y'all!
        <li>The food. Actually it was not great, but since I've complained about the food the last couple of days, I better say that the stuff was decent today.</li>
</ul>
<h3>:? The disappointments</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This being the last day and all.</li>
	<li>Poor array of presentations, especially this afternoon.</li>
</ul>

Thank you all for a great conference. I've talked to a lot of old buddies and really loved writing a lot of blog posts.
