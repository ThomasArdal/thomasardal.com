I've been to a lot of conferences and watched a lot of recorded talks online. Once in a while you come by something that either touches your deepest feelings or motivate you to go build something great. This list is a compilation of the 5 first talks that I came up with during a brainstorm of awesome non-technical talks.

<strong>David Heinemeier Hansson at Startup School 08</strong>
DHH delivers some strong pointers about charging money for your products. Tips that I have been using in all of the products that I've build.

<strong>To The Moon - Russ Olsen</strong>
Russ Olsen tells a story about the moon landing. I was at GOTO that year and even though the talk didn't touched me much at the time, I keep coming back to it.

<strong>Randy Pausch Last Lecture: Achieving Your Childhood Dreams</strong>
What a motivator. Randy knows he is going to die within months, but still manage to inspire.

<strong>Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address</strong>
Probably don't need any introduction. Steve Jobs was a genious.

<strong>How to Become Accomplished - Chad Fowler</strong>
I heard Chad Fowler speek at the GOTO conference back in 2013. The talk is sort of a live version of Chads book The Passionate Programmer but hearing it straight from the horses mouth pushed me to become an entrepreneur.
