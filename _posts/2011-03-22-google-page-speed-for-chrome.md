This week I’m taking a little detour from the YSlow rule series. Earlier today, <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/03/page-speed-for-chrome-and-in-40.html" target="_blank">Google announced Page Speed for Chrome</a>. As mentioned in a previous post, Chrome users have been limited to Google Speed Tracer, but now they also have the possibility of using Page Speed inside Chrome.

I've tried out the new plugin, and besides a better-looking UI, the plugin works pretty much like the Firefox equivalent. What surprised me a bit was the score, which sums differently in Chrome and Firefox. I can't really figure out why the scores are different, but it looks like the rules in the two versions are a bit different.
