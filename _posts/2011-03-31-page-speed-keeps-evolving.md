Last week I blogged about Google making Page Speed available for Chrome users. This week Google surprises me again, by doing <a href="http://pagespeed.googlelabs.com/">Page Speed Online</a>. Page Speed Online is pretty much just an online edition of Page Speed for Firefox and Chrome. The funny thing is, that I just a couple of posts ago votes against Google in the YSlow - Page Speed battle. Now I think that Yahoo actually needs to deliver something new to keep up with Google.

Update: I just realized, that there's a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ninejjcohidippngpapiilnmkgllmakh" target="_blank">Chrome YSlow extension</a> as well. I'm really looking forward to see, which new tools this competition between Yahoo and Google will bring us.
