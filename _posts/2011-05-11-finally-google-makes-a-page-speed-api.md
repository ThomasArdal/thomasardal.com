A lot of new stuff is released by Google these days. The Google I/O conference typically means a bunch of new products and API's and this year are no different. In regards to performance optimization, I was very happy to discover a new Page API earlier today. That's right, folks! A new and shiny API, making the Page Speed rules open for everyone to integrate into their products. Actually, I requested this feature last year (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/page-speed/issues/detail?id=279">http://code.google.com/p/page-speed/issues/detail?id=279</a>), why I'm even happier to see it implemented.

I'm really looking forward to see exciting new products, using the Page Speed API. In fact, I'm working on a product myself, which will definitely be using the Page Speed API. Stay tuned for more info soon.
