Second day at <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2013/" target="_blank">GOTO Aarhus</a> has ended. Another great day with a lot of interesting presentations. Unlike yesterday I didn't have any problems filling in the different slots. Well done GOTO!
<h3>:D The highlights</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2013/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=845" target="_blank">Web Security</a> track this morning. Both presentations were excellent.<a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2013/presentation/Taking%20The%20Hippie%20Bus%20To%20The%20Enterprise">
</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2013/presentation/Elasticsearch%20-%20Beyond%20full-text%20search" target="_blank">ElasticSearch - Beyond full-text search</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/spinscale" target="_blank">Alex Reelsen</a>. It was nice to see some of the new features of ElasticSearch 1.0.</li>
</ul>
<h3>:? The disappointments</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The keynote. I were looking forward to hear about new features in Java 8 and where a bit disappointed about how few features actually made it and the presentation in general. Brian is a smart guy, but he didn't really do anything to get me hooked on Java again. Thank god I erased my Java skills from LinkedIn last year :)</li>
	<li>The food. The launch where somewhat average yesterday and pretty awful today. I can't remember eating stuff like that since military.</li>
	<li>I couldn't attend the D3 talk, because it were happening at the same time as the ElasticSearch presentation.</li>
</ul>
