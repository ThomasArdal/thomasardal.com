My first day as a blogger on GOTO Aarhus has ended. It has been a great day with lots of presentations, networking, blogging and even coding.

<h3>:D The highlights</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2013/presentation/Taking%20The%20Hippie%20Bus%20To%20The%20Enterprise">Taking The Hippie Bus To The Enterprise</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mookid8000">Mogens Heller Grabe</a>. I'm so happy for Mogens and his new job as NServiceBus, but still sad to hear him talk about Rebus for the last time.</li>
	<li><a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2013/presentation/Why%20Agile%20doesn't%20scale,%20and%20what%20you%20can%20do%20about%20it">Why Agile doesn't scale, and what you can do about it</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod" target="_blank">Dan North</a>. Dan had a lot of great points and clearly know what he's talking about as well a great presenter.</li>
	<li>Networking. I probably talked to around 30 different people today, which have been great. Looking forward catching up with more former colleegesÂ tomorrow.</li>
	<li>Blogging. I ended up doing some coding during two of the presentations, which resulted in a blog post about <a href="http://thomasardal.com/developing-node-js-applications-in-visual-studio/" target="_blank">node.js in Visual Studio</a> and another <a href="http://thomasardal.com/handlebars-js-versus-knockout/" target="_blank">comparing Handlebars.js and Knockout</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>:? The disappointments</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The keynotes. Both keynotes where not really my cup of tea. I'm looking forward to hearing about Javas past, present and future tomorrow.</li>
	<li>The missing breakfast. What went wrong? Previously GOTO always kicked off with something for the stomach. Gotta remember eating breakfast from home tomorrow.</li>
	<li>The program in general. Today were without doubt the weakest day of this year's conference. I had problems finding interesting presentations in some of the slots, but that gave me an excellent excuse to do some coding, while pretending to be listening :)</li>
</ul>
