Hi and welcome to my new blog. During my years as a professional software developer, I've learned a thing or two about performance-optimizing software applications (both desktop and web applications). I've studied a lot of blog posts in order to solve different performance-related problems. This blog is my small donation back to the community.

I will primarily be writing about performance-optimizing websites in ASP.NET (MVC), but a lot of the concepts are portable to other technologies like PHP and Java Servlets (and even Ruby on Rails).
